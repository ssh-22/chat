# Chat App

This is a TypeScript-based chat app that allows users to have one-on-one or group conversations with LINE-style UI. The app includes messaging, voice calling, and video calling features.

## Technologies Used

The server-side of the app is built using `Node.js`, `Express`, `ws`, and `TypeScript`,while the front-end is built with `React` and `TypeScript`. The version of Node.js used for the backend is 18 and 16 for the front-end.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. In the `frontend` directory, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Make sure you have Node.js version 16 installed.
3. In the `backend` directory, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Make sure you have Node.js version 18 installed.
